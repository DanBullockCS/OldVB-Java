***Help***

It is recommended that the game is played in the netbeans output console.
Please maxmize the size of the output console to enjoy the game to its full potential.

To play open the game in the console of a program that reads java code.
Make sure that the textbox is highlighted and enter in the commands the game tells you, for example:

1 - Attack
2 - Use Potion
3 - Run Away

Type in "1" and then hit enter to attack.

Hints:
-To continue through most of the text the game the word "continue" is used often, try copying that word
so it can be pasted easily to progress quickly.
-Level up during in the starting forest to gain some good stats.
