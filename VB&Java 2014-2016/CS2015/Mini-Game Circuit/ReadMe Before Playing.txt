To Whom it may concern:

This game as originally going to be "Super Mario" themed, but was scrapped due to disinterest.
The "Game1" mini-game was a matching game which was scrapped due to time restraints.
Game1's unfinished code, design, and resources are still in the game files if you're feeling keen.

Other then that enjoy the game.

Please visit the "How to play" section beforing adventuring into any of the mini-games.
